  story:
  - 'Was it... sorrow? '
  - 'You: This ribbon means a lot to you, doesn''t it? '
  - 'You turn to the girl, who nods. '
  - You suddenly remember that it was the exam week, and -
  - 'You:Oh gosh, I just realized. The exam! You didn''t have your ribbon for the
    exam! '
  - 'You:Was the exam okay for you without the ribbon? '
  - 'The girl smiles weakly. '
  - 'Short Girl:Oh... right... you still don''t get it... do you...? '
  - 'You shoot the girl a confused look. '
  - 'She stares at you wistfully. '
  - 'Short Girl:Well, I guess that''s not completely true. '
  - 'She starts glancing around and shifting nervously. '
  - 'Short Girl:You know... I have to confess something to you. '
  - 'Short Girl:I... already know where my ribbon is. '
  - 'You get even more confused. '
  - 'You:But I thought you - '
  - 'Short Girl:I... never liked you. '
  - 'You:Excuse me? Um... I''m so sorry, have we met before? '
  - You:You were waiting for me? What for?
  - 'Short Girl:Well... to say I never liked you would be an understatement. '
  - 'Short Girl:I actually completely hated you. '
  - 'Short Girl:And for no good reason really. I... was just jealous of you. '
  - 'Short Girl:I watched you with your stupid music player. Your good luck charm. '
  - 'Short Girl:I knew what it meant to you. You took it everywhere you went. And
    your life has been great. '
  - 'Short Girl:Unlike me. '
  - 'You:When you lost your ribbon... you must have been devastated. '
  - 'You:I know I would be if I ever lost my music player. '
  - 'The girl sighs. '
  - 'Short Girl:I saw you listening to your ''lucky'' song so often... to make your
    life better. '
  - 'Short Girl:I can hear it. I hear you hum it all the time, so upbeat, so chipper,
    it started to make me sick. '
  - 'Short Girl:But today... today of all days... you never once listened to it. '
  - 'You feel a little disturbed. '
  - 'You:Wait, but I''ve never even seen you at this school before. I didn''t realize
    someone was paying such close attention to me. '
  - 'Short Girl:Well... I don''t go to this school anymore. '
  - 'Short Girl:Wow... has it really been that long? 40 years... I was at this school
    40 years ago. '
  - 'You stare in shock as the girl fades away... '
  - '...and fades back in. '
  - You:You-- You're--
  - 'Short Girl:I really did hate you. Truly. It was blind rage, really. '
  - 'Short Girl:For the past 40 years, I''ve only been reenacting my death, over
    and over. '
  - 'Short Girl:But talking with you here... I can''t do it. '
  - You:Do what?
  - 'Short Girl:It''s... nothing. '
  - 'She looks away, staring into the distance contemplatively. '
  - Short Girl:I... I'm sorry for interrupting your day. It is your exam week. I-
    I should go.
  - '-:'
  - 'The girl fades away. '
  - 'You feel like you helped her out in some way, but you can''t help but feel there
    was more to her story. '
  - 'Regardless, you never saw her again. '
  - 'Unsure what to think of the whole experience, you go to cafeteria to eat your
    lunch and study for the next exam. '
