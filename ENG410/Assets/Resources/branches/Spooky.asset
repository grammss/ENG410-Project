  story:
  - 'You did study for the exam today, but for some reason, you feels up for thrills
    and adventure. '
  - 'It must be the from getting couped up and studying so much. Your mind and body
    is craving some danger! '
  - 'You decide to put on your spookiest song, normally one you''d play for Halloween
    ambience. Why not? '
  - 'Strange things always seem to happen when you play this song - at least, you
    start to get a heightened sense of alert. '

  - '{:'
  - Later...
  - '*Hallway:'
  - 'Speaking of strange things, as you walk along the hallway and approach your
    classroom, out of the corner of your eye... '
  - '5:'
  - '...you notice a strange black cat. '
  - '9:'
  - 'It was sitting at the entrance of the staircase at the end of the hallway. That
    staircase leads to the rooftop. '
  - 'You don''t remember the school having any cats before. '
  - 'Aren''t black cats a symbol of bad luck or something? '
  - '9:'
  - 'As you turns to look at the cat, it cocks its head to the side, acknowledging
    your stare. '
  - 'The cat gets up... and appears to beckon you to follow it up the staircase. '
  - '7:'
  - 'This is starting to get strange... but almost like you wished for. '
  - 'Even though you had an exam starting - right at this moment in fact - '
  - '...you couldn''t help but feel your body gravitate towards the cat''s call. '
  - '{:'
  - 'What''s more thrilling than skipping an exam for a quick adventure? '
  - '*:'
  - 'You follow the cat up the staircase to the rooftop. '
  - '*RoofA:'
  - 'As soon at you reach the rooftop, you are immediately greeted with a scene and
    a half. '
  - '>evil angry:'
  - '&:'
  - 'A short girl you don''t recognize is arguing with a dark figure - a boy clouded
    in darkness. '
  - 'Dark Figure:Yorumi, please! '
  - '^:'
  - 'Yorumi:I... HATE YOU! You BETRAYED me! '
  - 'Dark Figure:Yorumi, listen! I-it was just a prank! '
  - '^:'
  - 'Yorumi:I can''t believe I trusted you! My ribbon... My poor, poor ribbon... '
  - Dark Figure:Yorumi... we need to have a talk about this ribbon. It's getting
    kind of ridi-
  - '&:'
  - '-:'
  - 'This whole time you listened to their argument, Yorumi''s name seemed so familiar
    to you. '
  - 'And for some reason you knew she was going to jump from the building! '
  - 'Just as Yorumi reached the ledge, you ran to her, grabbed her, and stopped her. '
  - '>evil angry:'
  - 'She kicked and screamed against your restraint, but you stand your ground. '
  - '^:'
  - 'As she struggles against you, you notice her body is ice cold. '
  - '>annoyed:'
  - 'It suddenly clicks with you - you read about Yorumi''s suicide some time ago! '
  - 'Did you just stop a ghost from jumping? Aren''t ghosts untouchable or something? '
  - 'Regardless, you realize you are in an encounter with some paranormal manifestation
    of Yorumi. '
  - 'Wow, this ambience has really got you thinking about paranormal activity. But
    it seems pretty clear to you. '
  - 'But now... there''s no way you go back to your exam now. You feel some sense
    of responsibility for Yorumi now. '
  - 'Now would be a good time to change the ambience - you probably don''t need this
    ambience for the aftermath... '
  - '*Please select a song (cannot choose the same song)* '
