  story:
  - "You:I will help you find it. What does it look like?\r"
  - "GG:It is red with white frills on the sides with a star accessory.\r"
  - "The clouds gather and the sky darkens.\r"
  - "You:We will find it. You walk around and start searching the rooftop.\r"
  - "Looking around the roof you spot a few suspicious areas.\r You look under the
    water tanks and there is dust and debris.\r "
  - "A slight glimmer under the tank could be spotted.\r You reach in and grab what
    you think looks like a ribbon.\r You pulled out a worned out dull red ribbon
    bleached by the sun and time.\r"
  - "The ribbon has the frills as described but they are grey with dirt and dust.\r
    The star accessory is scratched up and faded.\r You wonder if this ribbon belongs
    to the girl.\r"
  - "You slip the ribbon in your pocket and walk over to the girl, who is still searching
    under some water tanks.\r You show her the ribbon you found.\r "
  - "She thanks you profusely and wears it carefully.\r"
  - "You:Why don\u2019t we go take a break in the library, the rain looks like it
    is coming in anytime too.\r"
  - "GG:Sure, let's take shelter in the library then.\r"
  - "You offer your hand to help her up.\r She did not seem to notice.\r"
  - "You made your way to the library with the girl and hung out with her at the
    library. \r"
  - 'You found some common interest in some topics and read some books together.

'
  - "Roused by a cute voice I woke up to search for the voice.\r"
  - "The bell chimes and the library is closing.\r"
  - "You:Let\u2019s grab dinner at the cafeteria?\r"
  - 'You hang out with the girl at the cafeteria. Your classmates passed by and you
    waved to them and they waved back before heading home.

'
  - "It was fun hanging out with this girl and you hope to see her again.\r"
  - "You:I didn\u2019t catch your name.\r"
  - "Yorumi:Oh, I am Yorumi from 2-B.\r"
  - "You:So, will I see you tomorrow? \r\n"
  - "Yorumi:Yeah, see you tomorrow.\r"
  - "I bid farewell as I left school.\r"
  - '*Please select a song (can choose the same song)*'
