  story:
  - 'The change in music did not help. '
  - 'No longer could you feel at ease. It didn''t matter what song you chose anymore. '
  - 'You constantly felt like you were being watched. You could hardly concentrate
    on your studying. '
  - '{:'
  - 'It wasn''t helping, so you decide to take off your headphones. '
  - '*Classroom:'
  - 'The exam was no better. You could barely focus and could hardly recall your
    studies. '
  - '*WalkwayB:'
  - 'At the end of the day, you walked home with some friends, unable to stand being
    alone anymore. '
  - 'You had never felt so much unease in your life. Something had to change, now. '
  - 'You take a look at your music player. '
  - 'The spooky song was what did it. Wasn''t it? '
  - 'Your friends tell you it''s all in your head. But you know something was just
    wrong. '
  - '<:'
  - 'You had to do it. Your friends were shocked, but it had to be done. '
  - 'The effect was almost immediate. You felt the unease lift as soon as the music
    player left your hand and into the garbage. '
  - 'You were starting to grow out of needing this crutch of a music player anyway. '
  - 'It was going to be a brand new you. '
  - 'One of your friends joked that you are finally an adult, no longer a baby. '
  - 'Another one of your friends joked that the music player may have been haunted. '
  - 'You:Heh. Maybe. '
  - 'You:But at least I''m no longer defined by something else. '
