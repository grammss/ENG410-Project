  story:
  - Was it... desperation?
  - 'You: This ribbon means a lot to you, doesn''t it? '
  - 'You:You know, I think I can help you find your ribbon even faster. '
  - Short Girl:How would you do that?
  - 'You:Well, like I said, my music player is my lucky charm. And I know this may
    sound stupid to you, but '
  - 'You:And I know this may sound stupid to you, but when I play my happiest song,
    I feel like I can do anything. '
  - 'You:So this should speed up the search. I know I''d hate to lose my lucky charm
    on the day of the exam. '
  - 'You:I''ll find your ribbon. I promise. '
  - 'The girl simply stares at you as you begin the search once more with renewed
    confidence. '
  - 'Sure enough, you quickly find the ribbon under one of the water tanks. Just
    as you knew you would. '
  - 'You return the ribbon to the girl. '
  - 'Short Girl:Wow, you actually found it. I''ve been searching for it for 4 days.
    Thanks so much. '
  - 'You:Yeah, this happy music really gives me the boost when I need it. '
  - 'She carefully wears it, with a gleam in her eye. '
  - 'Short Girl:You know... I have to confess something to you. '
  - 'She pauses nervously. '
  - 'Short Girl:I... never liked you. '
  - 'You:Excuse me? Um... I''m so sorry, have we met before? '
  - 'Short Girl:No! We haven''t. It''s just... I''ve been watching you for a while.
    To be honest, I knew you liked coming to the rooftop. '
  - You:You were waiting for me? What for?
  - 'Short Girl:Well... to say I never liked you would be an understatement. '
  - 'Short Girl:I actually completely hated you. '
  - 'Short Girl:And for no good reason really. I... was just jealous of you. '
  - 'Short Girl:I watched you with your stupid music player. Your good luck charm. '
  - 'Short Girl:I knew what it meant to you. You took it everywhere you went. And
    your life has been great. '
  - 'Short Girl:Unlike me. '
  - 'You think about her words carefully. Slowly you realize what she means. '
  - 'You:Your ribbon. '
  - 'Short Girl:Yes... '
  - 'She gets a distant look in her eyes. '
  - 'Short Girl:When I lost my ribbon... I... '
  - 'A tear rolls down her cheek. '
  - 'You:I mean, hey, I get it. I''d probably feel lost in life too without my music
    player. '
  - 'You:So I''m glad you have your ribbon back. '
  - 'You:Oh gosh, I just realized. The exam! You didn''t have your ribbon for the
    exam! '
  - 'You:Was the exam okay for you without the ribbon? '
  - 'The girl smiles weakly. '
  - 'Short Girl:Oh... right... you still don''t get it... do you...? '
  - 'You shoot the girl a confused look. '
  - 'She looks at you with content, touching her trusty ribbon. '
  - 'Short Girl:Well, I guess that''s not completely true. '
  - 'Short Girl:If only... he were as understanding as you... '
  - '-:'
  - Short Girl:Thank you so much for talking with me... .......
  - You stare in shock as the girl faded away. Was she... a ghost?
  - 'Still, you feel like you helped her out, and she seems to be at peace. '
  - 'Unsure what to think of the whole experience, you go to cafeteria to eat your
    lunch and study for the next exam. '
