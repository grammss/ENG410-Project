  story:
  - 'You switch to your slow song. It always seems to give you some good emotional
    intuition. '
  - 'You:Yorumi... right? Are you okay? '
  - '>sad:'
  - 'Yorumi starts crying. '
  - '>distressed:'
  - '^:'
  - Yorumi:Why did you stop me...?
  - 'Yorumi:My ribbon... my boyfriend... my future... all gone... '
  - 'Yorumi:There is nothing to live for anymore! '
  - '-:'
  - 'You glanced around for the boy she was arguing with, who has mysteriously disappeared. '
  - '>sad:'
  - 'You:Your boyfriend? Was he the one you were yelling at just now? '
  - '>worried:'
  - 'Yorumi:Yes... He''s gone now... '
  - '>sad:'
  - 'You:Where did he go? '
  - '>worried:'
  - 'Yorumi:I don''t know... But... everyday he comes back... and... '
  - 'It''s hard to understand Yorumi due to her crying between talking, but you try
    your best to pick out the words. '
  - '>distressed:'
  - 'Yorumi:I have to do this again... '
  - 'Again? Everyday? Yorumi is definitely some kind of paranormal manifestation. '
  - 'You:Yorumi... how long has this been going on? '
  - '>bored:'
  - 'Yorumi:Oh God... '
  - 'Yorumi takes her time to gather her bearings. She wipes her eyes and face with
    her uniform. '
  - 'She turns to face you. '
  - '>worried:'
  - 'Yorumi:Oh God... it''s you. '
  - 'You:You know me? Have you been... umm.. well haunting me? '
  - '>smug:'
  - 'Yorumi:Don''t flatter yourself. I''ve been watching everyone at this school. '
  - '>relieved:'
  - 'Yorumi actually chuckles a little to herself. A light-hearted chuckle. You feel
    some relief that she seems to be feeling better. '
  - '>normal:'
  - 'Yorumi:How ironic that you are the one here with me right now. '
  - '>bored:'
  - 'You:How do you mean? '
  - '>normal:'
  - 'Yorumi:It''s... just... nothing... It''s nothing. '
  - '>bored:'
  - 'She appears to eye your headphones for a bit. '
  - '>normal:'
  - 'Yorumi:Yeah, nothing... '
  - '^:'
  - '>bored:'
  - 'Yorumi sighs. '
  - '>shy:'
  - 'You:I read about you, Yorumi. I don''t remember all the details. But I remember
    your name. And your suicide. '
  - 'You:Somehow... when I saw you, and heard your name... I knew what you were about
    to do. I knew who you are. '
  - '>relieved:'
  - 'Yorumi:And... you saved me... That''s the first time I didn''t have to fully
    relive that... '
  - 'Yorumi:You know, for the last 40 years, no one has come to this rooftop at this
    time to see that. '
  - '>worried:'
  - 'Yorumi:Oh my God. 40 years of that... everyday. '
  - '>sad:'
  - 'You:Don''t tell me you''ve been reliving your suicide? '
  - '>worried:'
  - 'Yorumi:I have... I don''t know how much you saw... but that was what happened...
    40 years ago... '
  - '>sad:'
  - 'You:I see... But why are you reliving it? That must be torture! '
  - '>worried:'
  - 'Yorumi:It is... I don''t know why, but everyday I wake up again. And it''s the
    exact same day. Exact same situation. '
  - 'Even though she clearly does not enjoy reliving it, Yorumi is now sitting up
    straight, eager to retell it. '
  - '40 years... you cannot imagine killing yourself for 40 years everyday... and
    the loneliness she must feel afterwards... '
  - '>distressed:'
  - '^:'
  - 'Yorumi:It was a Thursday. I know because my ribbon went missing on the first
    day of exams! And I counted the days I felt so... '
  - '>sad:'
  - 'Yorumi:...so naked. So vulnerable. My ribbon... '
  - '>worried:'
  - 'Yorumi:I couldn''t focus. My boyfriend told me I was being stupid. Even I knew
    it was stupid. '
  - '^:'
  - 'Yorumi:But I just couldn''t focus. For 4 days I couldn''t focus. All my life
    my ribbon had been with me. '
  - '>sad:'
  - 'Yorumi:But without it... during the very final exams... '
  - '^:'
  - '>distressed:'
  - 'Yorumi:The stress was too much to bear! '
  - '^:'
  - 'Yorumi:I had failed every exam I took. I know it. '
  - '>sad:'
  - 'Yorumi:Finally... I refused to go to school on that Thursday. That''s when my
    boyfriend... '
  - 'Yorumi takes a deep breath. Her voice gets higher from the pain. '
  - '>worried:'
  - 'Yorumi:He came clean. He showed me where he hid it. He... why did he have to
    hide it here...? '
  - '>sad:'
  - 'Yorumi:It rained everyday. If... if he just kept it safe... I don''t know...
    Even then... '
  - 'Yorumi:Even then... my life was already over. My exams failed. '
  - 'Yorumi:My boyfriend sabotaged me. '
  - '^:'
  - '>distressed:'
  - 'Yorumi:And my ribbon... oh my ribbon... '
  - '>sad:'
  - 'You can tell she is getting a post traumatic experience just by picturing her
    ribbon, however it looked like after the rain. '
  - 'You:Yorumi... I''m sorry. '
  - 'You:I... don''t know what to say. But I''m so sorry for your loss. '
  - '>shy:'
  - 'Yorumi:Heh. I... wow. '
  - 'You:What? '
  - '>relieved:'
  - 'Yorumi:I just realized that you saved me. Oh, the irony. '
  - 'You:Heh. You''ve said that twice now. What''s the irony? '
  - '>shy:'
  - 'Yorumi thinks for a moment before answering. '
  - 'Yorumi:Well... I did kind of pay special attention to you. '
  - 'Yorumi:In many ways... I saw myself in you. '
  - '>relieved:'
  - 'Yorumi:You really do bring that music player everywhere, don''t you? '
  - '>shy:'
  - 'You:Yeah. I see what you mean. This music player is my ribbon. '
  - '>relieved:'
  - 'Yorumi:Heh. You know. It''s almost like I was saved by... '
  - '>shy:'
  - 'You:...yourself? '
  - '>relieved:'
  - 'Yorumi:...yeah... like a memory of my past cheerful self, the girl who always
    had her ribbon... '
  - '>shy:'
  - 'Yorumi sighs at stares thoughtfully at the sky. She appears so serene now. '
  - '>relieved:'
  - 'Yorumi:And with that... '
  - 'Yorumi:I really think I won''t be reliving that anymore. '
  - '^:'
  - 'Yorumi:Thank you so much... what even led you up here anyway? '
  - '>shy:'
  - 'You:I saw a black cat on my way to my exam. And I dunno, seemed strange so I
    followed it. '
  - '>relieved:'
  - 'Yorumi:A black cat? Mr Snufflebumps? Oh my God, the old school cat. '
  - 'You: Haha! Oh wow! I didn''t know this school had a cat! '
  - '^:'
  - '>distressed:'
  - 'Yorumi:Wait! Did you just say you were on your way to your exam?! '
  - '>sad:'
  - 'You:Oh. Heh. Well... I guess I was feeling a bit adventurous today, you could
    say. '
  - '^:'
  - '>distressed:'
  - 'Yorumi:Are you kidding?! Look, I''m glad you helped me and all, but your exam! '
  - '^:'
  - 'Yorumi:You can''t miss it! You''ll ruin your life! '
  - '>worried:'
  - 'You:Heh. Oh c''mon, Yorumi, I only missed 1 exam. I have a whole week of them. '
  - '^:'
  - '>distressed:'
  - 'Yorumi:But- '
  - '>sad:'
  - 'You:Yorumi. '
  - '-:'
  - '{:'
  - 'You decide to pull Yorumi into a hug. '
  - 'She feels cold to the touch, but somehow, you don''t get any chills from the
    paranormal embrace. '
  - 'You:I''m glad you''re okay now. '
  - 'You:This is the way things were meant to happen. Okay? '
  - 'Yorumi, surprised, eventually nods. '
  - 'Yorumi:Okay, but don''t miss another exam! '
  - 'You:Of course not. '
  - '*RoofA:'
  - '>smug:'
  - 'Yorumi smiles brightly at you. '
  - 'Yorumi:I... I should go. '
  - 'You think for a moment - '
  - 'You:Wait! '

  - 'Yorumi:Y-yes? '
  - '{:'
  - 'I remove my headphones, and fish the music player from my pocket. '
  - '>normal:'
  - 'You:Take this. '
  - 'Yorumi stares in shock. '
  - '>distressed:'
  - 'Yorumi:I- I- I couldn''t! Are you sure? '
  - '>bored:'
  - 'You:Yeah. Maybe the music player will be gone. '
  - 'You:But it''s already given me the boost I need. '
  - 'You point at your head. '
  - 'You:And the music will keep playing... here. '
  - '>smug:'
  - 'Yorumi giggles at how stupid you look doing that, and accepts your gift graciously. '
  - '>smug:'
  - 'Yorumi:Thank you... I will be... watching over you... '
  - '-:'
  - 'You wave at her as she fades away. '
  - 'Somehow, despite having just given away your most treasured possession, you
    feel... '
  - '{:'
  - '...even more confident than you did before. '
  - 'The whole experience felt like a life changer for you. '
  - 'You still have an exam coming up. With one exam missed, you''ll need to work
    extra hard. '
  - 'But even without your lucky charm, you still feel like yourself. In fact, you
    feel better than ever. '
  - 'It''s almost like you can always hear the music playing now, no matter where
    you go. '
