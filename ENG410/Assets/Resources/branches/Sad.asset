  story:
  - Feeling a little emo, you set some slow tunes, get on your bicycle and go to
    school.
  - "In the rural countryside, there were only a few students on campus, contrasting
    the bustling atmosphere of the school in the city you are used to.\r"
  - "You sit down for class and the teacher steps in soon after.\r"
  - "There were only 9 students in class and the pace was much slower.\r"
  - "After the boring classes in the morning you head to the rooftop for lunch.\r"
  - "A habit that stuck from your time in the city as the roof tops are generally
    quiet and peaceful as it is out of bounds to students.\r"
  - "It does not really affect you since you are not really a stickler for rules.\r"
  - "You reach the rooftop and find a quiet corner to eat your lunch but you notice
    a girl with disheveled hair searching the rooftop.\r"
  - "You walk up to her to check if she needs help.\r"
  - "You:Hey, is there something wrong?\r"
  - "The girl:I can't find my ribbon.\r"
  - "The girl was panicking.\r"
  - "You:If you lost it recently it couldn\u2019t have gone far.\r"
  - "You:Why don\u2019t you take a break, I will help you search in the meantime.\r"
  - "You:How does it look like? Tell me more about it.\r"
  - "< Select your music >\r"
