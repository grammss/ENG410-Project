  story:
  - 'You did study for the exam today. Since you feel a little nervous, some slow
    music sets the tone for you just right. '
  - You set some slow tunes, get on your bicycle and go to school.
  - '*Classroom:'
  - "You sit down for class and the teacher steps in soon after.\r The exam is starting
    now. "
  - '2 hours later... '
  - 'Whew! The exam would have been tough had you not studied for it. Still, you
    aren''t in the clear yet; there is another exam today.  '
  - '*RoofA:'
  - "A habit that stuck from your time in the city as the roof tops are generally
    quiet and peaceful as it is out of bounds to students.\r "
  - "It does not really affect you since you are not really a stickler for rules.\r"
  - "You reach the rooftop and find a quiet corner to eat your lunch, but you notice
    a girl you don't recognize searching the rooftop.\r"
  - "You walk up to her to check if she needs help.\r"
  - "You:Hey, is there something wrong?\r"
  - "Short Girl:I can't find my ribbon.\r"
  - "You:If you lost it recently, it couldn\u2019t have gone far.\r"
  - "You:Why don\u2019t you take a break, I will help you search in the meantime.\r"
  - "You:How does it look like? Tell me more about it.\r"
  - Yorumi:It's red, and small, so it is kind of hard to find.
  - '*Please select a song (can choose the same song)* '
