  - 'The butterflies in your stomach aren''t going away. Something was wrong. '
  - 'You suddenly noticed Yorumi''s eyes. They were bloodshot. '
  - '>annoyed:'
  - Cautiously, you back away from Yorumi. There was something strange about this
    girl. Something...
  - 'At the back of your mind, Yorumi''s name was ringing distant bells. '
  - 'You can''t quite place it, but you sense something bad is about to happen if
    you don''t leave now. '
  - 'Yorumi looks confused. '
  - 'Yorumi:What''s wrong? '
  - 'You:I- I have to go. '
  - 'You start to run, but Yorumi is right next to you. She grabs you by the arm. '
  - '>happy evil:'
  - 'Her touch is chilling. You start to feel your worst suspicions are true. '
  - 'Yorumi chuckles. '
  - 'Yorumi:Come on, weren''t you going to ask me out? '
  - 'You:Ah... well... '
  - '>evil angry:'
  - 'Yorumi:I don''t know what you''re thinking. But it doesn''t matter anymore. '
  - 'Yorumi:I''ve been watching you. YOU. And your stupid music player. '
  - '^:'
  - 'Yorumi:Every time you play your stupid lucky song and start coasting through
    life. '
  - '^:'
  - Yorumi:Ooh, look at me! I just play my happy song and everything goes well for
    me!
  - 'Yorumi:You make me SICK. '
  - '>annoyed:'
  - 'You cannot believe what you''re hearing. No one had ever criticized you for
    your music player before. '
  - 'You managed to stutter out an apology. '
  - 'You:I- I- I''m sorry. I- I don''t know what to s-say. I- '
  - '>happy evil:'
  - 'Yorumi cackles as she looks down at you on the ground, stuttering, when just
    moments ago you felt like her hero finding her ribbon. '
  - 'Yorumi:This is just how it happened. How it always happens. '
  - '^:'
  - 'With surprising strength, Yorumi picks you up in her arms and carries you to
    the roof top edge. '
  - 'Yorumi:Only one last thing that should happen. '
  - 'Realizing what she''s about to do, you scream, and beg for your life, for a
    reason, anything! '
  - '>annoyed:'
  - 'You:Why?! What did I do wrong?! Please! '
  - 'She holds you over the ledge. '
  - '>happy evil:'
  - 'Yorumi:Hmph. You''ll have plenty of time to think about that, where you''re
    going. '
  - '-:'
  - '{:'
  - 'Yorumi drops you. You scream as you plunge into certain death. '
  - 'You had your lucky music player. You were playing your happiest song. Maybe
    switching to your spookiest song wasn''t such a bright idea. '
