  story:
  - 'You managed to play your slow tune during this whole ordeal, and start begging
    for your life. '
  - 'You:Please. Yorumi! I remember now! '
  - 'She stops walking for a moment and throws you on the floor, seeming to give
    you a chance to explain. '
  - Yorumi:What do you know about me, hmm?
  - 'Grateful for the chance to talk your way out, you scramble to remember everything
    you remember. '
  - 'You:I read about your suicide! It was 40 years ago, wasn''t it? You went to
    this school! '
  - Yorumi:How do you know all of this?
  - 'You:I remember someone found the article online. They showed it to some people,
    and they started making the rumours! '
  - 'You:Rumours of the haunted rooftop! They say your ghost haunts this place. '
  - 'Yorumi:Well... I guess I can''t say they were wrong. '
  - 'She seems to be calming down, her rage dissipating. Talking is working! '
  - 'You:And you... you had a boyfriend! Your boyfriend was the one who reported
    your suicide! '
  - 'Yorumi:Him! '
  - 'Her rage appears to be bubbling up again! You quail in fright... '
  - '...but she appears to be looking elsewhere. '
  - 'Yorumi:It was all his fault! He ruined my life! '
  - 'You sit up, and try to understand, to be supportive of her. '
  - 'You:What happened? Please, tell me. '
  - 'Yorumi looks at you, as though she''d been wanting to vent about this for a
    very long time. '
  - 'Yorumi:He... took my ribbon. My favourite ribbon. On the Sunday right before
    the exam week. '
  - 'You start to realize what she means. '
  - 'You:The ribbon was your lucky charm wasn''t it? '
  - 'Yorumi:And he took it away and hid it. My own boyfriend. I thought he was ''the
    One''. I thought he knew me. '
  - 'Yorumi:I didn''t even know it was him who took it. I thought I just misplaced
    it. '
  - 'Yorumi:But still I couldn''t do it... Even though I studied so hard, I couldn''t
    focus. I couldn''t stop thinking about where my ribbon was. '
  - 'You:And you did badly? '
  - 'Yorumi:I had to have failed. I don''t really know, but I know. I had to. '
  - 'Yorumi was crying as she said all of this through tortured pain. '
  - 'Yorumi:I felt like my life was over. The finals I had failed... My ribbon...
    missing... '
  - 'Yorumi:Then he... my boyfriend told me... '
  - 'She was struggling to talk now. '
  - 'You:Did he confess? '
  - 'Yorumi:I still remember everything. I still remember... his stupid voice... '
  - 'Yorumi:''Just a prank... It was just a prank...'' '
  - Yorumi:And then he showed me... where he hid my ribbon... under the water tank,
    on this roof.
  - 'She stifled a squeal as she said this. '
  - 'Yorumi:Oh God! I can still see it! My poor, poor ribbon, dirty and wet from
    rain. '
  - 'Yorumi:I was furious! I thought my life was over already, but him! He... betrayed
    me. '
  - 'Yorumi:I... '
  - 'You:Yorumi... '
  - 'Yorumi looks at you with tears shining in her eyes. '
  - 'You:I''m so sorry. '
  - '{:'
  - 'You decide to hug her. She seemed slightly taken aback, but accepts. She cries
    into your shoulder. '
  - 'She feels cold to the touch, but somehow, you don''t get any chills from the
    paranormal embrace. '
  - '*RoofA:'
  - 'She lets go of you, wiping her tears. '
  - 'Yorumi:You know, it''s been 40 years, and I haven''t felt so relieved. '
  - 'You:Well, bottling up your problems is never a good thing. '
  - 'She smiles weakly at you. '
  - 'You:By the way, you were searching for your ribbon, weren''t you? Is that it
    under the water tank there? '
  - 'She doesn''t even turn to look. '
  - 'Yorumi:Heh, I know. I... wanted you to return it to me, and so that I could
    lure you close to me to kill you. '
  - 'You:Why? '
  - 'Yorumi:I''m sorry. I really don''t know anymore. And I''m really sorry for almost
    killing you. '
  - 'There is an awkward silence. '
  - 'Yorumi:I know I am already dead. I know you may not forgive me. '
  - 'Yorumi:But still... all these years of haunting this place. I never really found
    my peace. '
  - 'Yorumi:But right now, at this very moment, I think I finally found it. '
  - 'You:I''m glad I could help. '
  - 'There is another awkward silence. '
  - 'Yorumi:You know... there is one more thing. '
  - 'Yorumi:Sometimes, I get moments of clarity, while I was watching you. '
  - 'Yorumi:I see you... surrounded by all these other people. Without a music player. '
  - 'Yorumi:You are the only one just like me. '
  - 'You:Yeah, my friends do tease me that I rely on it a bit too much. '
  - 'Yorumi:But I wonder... '
  - 'You can see where she''s going with this. '
  - 'You:Do you want me to-? '
  - 'Yorumi:All these years... I was obsessed with my ribbon. '
  - 'Yorumi:But maybe that was my chance. Maybe my boyfriend did mean well. '
  - 'Yorumi:I don''t know if he did, but... '
  - 'She looks away shyly. '
  - '<:'
  - 'You take off your headphones, and fish out your music player. '
  - 'You:Yorumi, this is for you. '
  - 'You place your headphones and your music player on the floor, take a deep breath,
    close your eyes, and ready yourself. '
  - 'Yorumi:Are you sure? '
  - 'You:Yeah. Maybe the music player will be gone. '
  - 'You:But it''s already given me the boost I need. '
  - 'You point at your head. '
  - 'You:And the music will keep playing... here. '
  - 'You stomp on the music player and headphones, with a very audible crunch. '
  - 'Yorumi takes her ribbon from under the water tank. '
  - 'Yorumi:All these years... '
  - 'She tears her ribbon in half. '
  - 'You:Heh. I know you did try to kill me, but... '
  - 'You:I feel... '
  - 'Yorumi:...free. '
  - 'You:Yeah... '
  - '-:'
  - 'Yorumi:Thank you... and I''m so sorry for everything... ...... '
  - 'You wave at her as she fades away. '
  - 'Somehow, despite having just destroyed your most treasured possession, you feel... '
  - '{:'
  - '...liberated. '
  - 'The whole experience felt like a life changer for you, even though it only lasted
    a few minutes. '
  - 'The whole experience felt like a life changer for you, even though it only lasted
    a few minutes. '
  - 'You still have an exam coming up. Even without your lucky charm, you still feel
    like yourself. '
  - 'It''s almost like your trusty music player is still in your pocket, giving you
    all the assurance you need. '
