  story:
  - 'For some reason, you can''t help but feel that something is off with the girl. '
  - 'You play your spookiest tune to heighten your ''sus'' sensors. '
  - 'For starters, most other students never come to the rooftop for fear of punishment. '
  - 'You''ve also never seen this girl before. '
  - 'You:I''m sorry, but who are you? I feel like I''ve seen everyone in school before,
    but I don''t recognize you. '
  - 'The girl frowns at you. '
  - Yorumi:I'm Yorumi. I'm from class 2B. Aren't you going to help me search for
    my ribbon?
  - 'Yorumi... Yorumi... for some reason, that name rings a bell. A very distant
    bell. '
  - 'Yorumi:Is something wrong? You have a weird look on your face. '
  - 'You:I''m sorry, but I... how should I put this? Have we met before? '
  - 'Yorumi:No... why? '
  - 'You:I feel like I''ve heard of your name before. '
  - 'Yorumi:Huh. Where? '
  - 'You:Actually, I don''t think I heard it. I''ve SEEN it before. In- '
  - 'Yorumi:The library? '
  - 'You:Yes! Oh my god! Are you a- '
  - 'To answer you, Yorumi fades away... '
  - '...and fades back in. '
  - 'You can only stare in shock. '
  - 'Yorumi:Heheh... you know... it''s true what they say. I DO intend to kill you. '
  - 'You:No way- I- '
  - 'Yorumi starts laughing as she starts walking towards you. '
  - 'You don''t have enough time to complete your response as you dash for the staircase
    exit. '
  - 'But Yorumi catches up with you. '
  - 'Yorumi:Heh. '
  - 'She drags you back to the rooftop with surprising strength. '
  - 'Yorumi:I''ve been watching you... for a long time... '
  - 'Yorumi:I hated you... HATED you... SO much... '
  - 'You couldn''t believe your ears. Was this personal? What could it be about? '
  - 'As she continues dragging you to the rooftop ledge, you feel your hand on your
    trusty music player in your pocket. '
  - 'This spooky music cannot continue! '
  - '*Please select a song (cannot choose the same song)* '
