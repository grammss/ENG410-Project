  - 'Yorumi starts laughing. Cute little giggles. Oh no. You said something wrong,
    didn''t you? '
  - 'But with this happy music playing, you can''t go wrong. Maybe she''s laughing
    because she thinks I''m cute? '
  - 'With that thought, you regain your confidence and try again. '

  - 'With surprising strength, Yorumi picks you up in her arms and carries you to
    the roof top edge. '
